					Blather is an educational tool that allows users to analyze and pinpoint the
					accuracy of claims made on social media. This site is meant to help people spot
					out erroneous logic so that similar arguments will not be made in the future.
					However, there are a number of factors that make this a difficult task.
				</p>

					<List.Item>Cognitive dissonance</List.Item>
					<List.Item>Confirmation bias</List.Item>
					<List.Item>Conspiratorial thinking</List.Item>

					Unfortunately, all of those are baked into the human psyche and they help
					contribute to a toxic landscape that hinders perfectly sane people from engaging

					it means to have a discussion; which is to change minds.

					As a user of Blather, you must put forth an honest attempt to understand different points of view. 
					This applies to all users regardless of their ideologies. 
					Personal insults should be avoided and racial slurs will not be tolerated.

				<p>
					Content on Blather comes from Tweets and videos and comments from YouTube. 
					Once a piece of content has been viewed on Blather it gets saved in our database and becomes viewable to anyone whether or not they are a member. 
					However, you must be a member to assign a fallacy to a piece of content. 
					Tweets, videos and comments can be archived with <a href="http://archive.is" target="_blank">archive.is</a> so that if someone deletes their content in an attempt to save face there is still a record of it.
				</p>

				<Header as="p" size="small">Discussions</Header>
				<p>
					Discussions happen in a format that helps facilitate a genuine understanding of what the opposing side has to say instead of just hurling insults and buzz words.
					Only one respone at a time can be made. 
					Discussions cannot be edited. This is done to prevent people from moving the goal posts.
					If someone is genuinely interested in hearing what you have to say and they're aren't trying to catch you in a "gotcha" moment then they should grant you opportunity to clarify your position.
					Discussions don't always work well and sometimes the evidence presented isn't enough to genuinely convince someone and that is perfectly fine. 
					But, an honest attempt to understand the opposing side's point of view is a must.
				</p>

				<Header as="p" size="small">Fallacies</Header>
				<p>
					Currently, users may pick one out of <Link to='/fallacies'>54 fallacies</Link> to assign to a piece of content. 
					The fallacies that you assign are viewable to everyone including people who are not signed up with Blather.
					Please make sure that you actually understand what the fallacy means before assigning it.
